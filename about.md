# 2 PLAYERS DEATH COUNTER!!!

Your friends blame you for always being the one who dies?? Tired of being told that you were the one who died the most when it isn't true??????

Here is 2P DEATH COUNTER!!!!!!!

SUPER FEATURES:

- Name of each player CUSTOMIZABLE
- Color of each player CUSTOMIZABLE
- Position of each counter CUSTOMIZABLE

## THIS DOESNT COUNT NOT DUAL DEATHS

And a super button on the pause menu that is a shortcut to the mod config!!!!!! 

And if you dont want to disable the mod there is a option to hide the counter!!!

### THIS IS MY AMAZING FIRST MOD SO IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF AWESOME IDEAS FOR THIS PLEASE TELL ME :DDDD

(Compatible with globed 2-Player mode)
